The main goal of gizio is to replace ``readsnap.py`` as a more flexible to use and better maintained tool, but not too much more complicated to understand. More specificlly, gizio is supposed to:

* Replace ``readsnap.py``.
* Stay simple in implementation with a minimum set of features to be useful.
* Focus on GIZMO snapshot IO, with extensibility to other GADGET family members in mind.
* Serve as an independant implementation of the GIZMO snapshot specification to cross check with other codes.

Note that gizio does not intend to compete with the more general tools like `yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_ or `pynbody <http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/>`_. gizio is serving at a lower level and in a much more limited scope.
